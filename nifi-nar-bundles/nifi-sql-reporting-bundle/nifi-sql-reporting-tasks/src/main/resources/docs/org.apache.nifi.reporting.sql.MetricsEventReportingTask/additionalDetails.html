<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    This reporting task can be used to issue SQL queries against various NiFi metrics information,  submit returned data to a rules engine (which will determine if any actions should be performed)
    and execute the prescribed actions using action handlers. This task requires a RulesEngineService (which will identify any actions that should be performed) and an ActionHandler which will execute the action(s).
    A distinct ActionHandler can be used to service all events or an ActionHandlerLookup can be used for dynamic handler lookup. NOTE: Optimally action handler should be associated with the expected action types
    returned from the rules engine.
</p>
<p>
    The reporting task can uniquely handle items from the bulletin and provenance repositories. This means that an item will only be processed once when the query is set to unique.
    The query can be set to unique by defining a time window with special sql placeholders ($bulletinStartTime, $bulletinEndTime, $provenanceStartTime, $provenanceEndTime)
    that the reporting task will evaluate runtime. See the SQL Query Examples section.

<h2>SQL Query Examples</h2>
<p>
    <b>Example:</b> Select all fields from the <code>CONNECTION_STATUS</code> table:<br/>
<pre>SELECT * FROM CONNECTION_STATUS</pre>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    <b>Example:</b> Select connection IDs where time-to-backpressure (based on queue count) is less than 5 minutes:<br/>
<pre>SELECT connectionId FROM CONNECTION_STATUS_PREDICTIONS WHERE predictedTimeToCountBackpressureMillis < 300000</pre>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    <b>Example:</b> Get the unique bulletin categories associated with errors:<br/>
<pre>SELECT DISTINCT(bulletinCategory) FROM BULLETINS WHERE bulletinLevel = "ERROR"</pre>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Example:</b> Select all fields from the <code>BULLETINS</code> table with time window:<br/>
<pre>SELECT * from BULLETINS WHERE bulletinTimestamp > $bulletinStartTime AND bulletinTimestamp <= $bulletinEndTime</pre>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Example:</b> Select all fields from the <code>PROVENANCE</code> table with time window:<br/>
<pre>SELECT * from PROVENANCE where timestampMillis > $provenanceStartTime and timestampMillis <= $provenanceEndTime</pre>
</p>
