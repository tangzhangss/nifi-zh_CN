        <h2>JASN1Reader</h2>

        <p>
            This service creates record readers for ASN.1 input.
        </p>
        <p>
            ASN.1 schema files (with full path) can be defined via the <i>Root Model Name</i> property as a comma separated list.
            The controller service preprocesses these files and generates sources that it uses for parsing data later.<br/>
            <b>
                Note that this preprocessing may take a while, especially when the schema files are large.
                The service remains in the <i>Enabling</i> state until this preprocessing is finished.
                Processors using the service are ready to be started at this point but probably won't work properly until the service is fully <i>Enabled</i>.
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            The root model type can be defined via the <i>Root Model Name</i> property. It's format should be "MODULE-NAME.ModelType".
            "MODULE-NAME" is the name of the ASN module defined at the beginnig of the ASN schema file.
            "ModelType" is an ASN type defined in the ASN files that is not referenced by any other type.
            The reader created by this service expects ASN records of this root model type.</br>
        </p>
        <p>
            More than one root model types can be defined in the ASN schema files but one service instance can only work with one such type at a time.
            Multiple different ASN data types can be processed by creating multiple instances of this service.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            The ASN schema files are ultimately compiled into Java classes in a temporary directory when the service is enabled.
            (The directory is deleted when the service is disabled. Of course the ASN schema files remain.)
            The service actually needs the fully qualified name of the class compiled from the root model type.
            It usually guesses the name of this class correctly from <i>Root Model Name</i>.<br/>
            However there may be situations where this is not the case.
            Should this happen, one can take use of the fact that NiFi logs the temporary directory where the compiled Java classes can be found.
            Once the proper class of the root model type is identified in that directory (should be easily done by looking for it by it's name)
                it can be provided directly via the <i>Root Model Class Name</i> property.
            (Note however that the service should be left <i>Enabled</i> while doing the search as it deletes the temporary directory when it is disabled.
            To be able to set the property the service needs to be disabled in the end - and let it remove the directory,
                however this shouldn't be an issue as the name of the root model class will be the same in the new temporary directory.)
